### Use of information
By registering on this platform you agree to the collection and use of the information you provide us in accordance with this policy. The personal information collected is used in a way that is compatible with the following purposes:

* to allow your use of SCEIBA's websites and services
* to create your personal account of the National Registry of Magazines of the Ministry of Higher Education
* to answer your questions
* for system administration, customer support and troubleshooting purposes
* for announcements of new services and updates (subscription required)
* to improve the design of our sites and services

Our work team will take reasonable measures to guarantee that personal information is used according to the aforementioned purposes. We declare that we do not sell or share personal information. General use data will be published in aggregate form so that no personal information is identifiable to participating institutions, content providers, researchers, and the general public.

### Cancellation of your account
Upon your request to cancel your account, we will remove your account and your personal information from our records. Your name and ORCID number will only be recorded if you have requested the inclusion of a journal in the National Registry of Journals of the Ministry of Higher Education or have provided us with feedback to improve their metadata. Please note that cancellation requests may prevent you from accessing content or services that are exclusively dedicated to registered users on our platform. The metadata of the journals that have been included in the National Registry of Journals of the Ministry of Higher Education will in no case be eliminated if the user who made the inclusion request requests the cancellation of their account.

### Data and metadata retention
We will retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as necessary to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, please contact us at sceiba.cu@gmail.com. Requests for partial or total elimination of metadata from a journal included in the National Registry of Journals of the Ministry of Higher Education will only be made after the expert group reports that decision in writing.
