/**
 * Represents a component used to search a query.
 *
 * In order to use this component with the correct i18n, you must include
 * (in your i18n translate files that are in the folder `assets\i18n`)
 * a translation key of name "TOCO_SEARCH_QUERY_INPUT" that contains
 * an object as value with the translation needed by this component.
 *
 * In the case of `es.json` file, you must include the following translation key:
    "TOCO_SEARCH_QUERY_INPUT": {
        "INPUT_SEARCH_LABEL": "Buscar",
        "INPUT_SEARCH_PLACEHOLDER": "Escriba un criterio y presione Enter",
        "BUTTON_SEARCH": "Buscar"
    }
 *
 * In the case of `en.json` file, you must include the following translation key:
    "TOCO_SEARCH_QUERY_INPUT": {
        "INPUT_SEARCH_LABEL": "Search",
        "INPUT_SEARCH_PLACEHOLDER": "Write a phrase and press Enter",
        "BUTTON_SEARCH": "Search"
    }
 *
 * If you have another language, then you have another `*.json` file,
 * and you must include the "TOCO_SEARCH_QUERY_INPUT" translation key with the correct translation values.
